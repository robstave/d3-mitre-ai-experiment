 Certainly! Here's a detailed description you can input into DALL·E to generate a visualization resembling the horizontal bar chart for the MITRE ATT&CK categories:

---

**Prompt for DALL·E:**

"An elegant, high-resolution horizontal bar chart visualizing the counts of issues across the 11 MITRE ATT&CK categories. The chart features the categories listed vertically along the left side (Y-axis), each clearly labeled with their category names. The bars extend horizontally to the right, with lengths proportional to their issue counts—some bars are short (sparse counts) while others are long (abundant counts). The counts are displayed along the bottom (X-axis), labeled 'Number of Issues'.

Each bar is in a distinct, vibrant color from a cohesive palette, enhancing visual appeal and differentiating the categories. The chart includes subtle gridlines for reference, and the design is clean and modern, reminiscent of professional data visualizations made with D3.js.

At the top, there's a concise title: 'MITRE ATT&CK Issues by Category'. Tooltips or data labels are shown hovering over a few bars, displaying exact counts and additional info. The overall style is professional and informative, suitable for a tech presentation or report."

Feel free to adjust or add any specific details to the prompt to better suit your vision. This description should help DALL·E generate an image that closely matches the visualization you're planning to create.
